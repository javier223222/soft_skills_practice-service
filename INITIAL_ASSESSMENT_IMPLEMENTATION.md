- A) Wait until after the meeting to speak privately with your manager
- B) **Respectfully ask clarifying questions during the meeting to highlight potential issues** ‚úÖ
- C) Directly point out the flaws in Sarah's proposal during the meeting  
- D) Stay silent to avoid conflict and address it later if problems arise

### Leadership Example:
**Scenario**: "Your team is facing a tight deadline on a critical project. Two of your best team members are in disagreement about the technical approach, and their conflict is slowing down progress. Both have valid points, but you need to make a decision quickly."

**Question**: "As the team leader, what is your best course of action?"

**Options**:
- A) Choose the approach from your most experienced team member
- B) **Facilitate a quick decision-making session with both members, set a deadline for resolution** ‚úÖ
- C) Make the decision yourself based on your understanding
- D) Ask the team to vote on which approach to take
